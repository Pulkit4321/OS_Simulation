Question:-
Scenario: A company has a large number of employees who work on various projects and create different types of files such as documents, spreadsheets, and images. The company wants to implement a new file system that can manage the disk space efficiently and handle the high volume of file operations. 

Problem: Create a simulation program that simulates a file system for the company. The program should include a file system manager that uses a specific file allocation algorithm (e.g. Contiguous Allocation or Linked Allocation) to allocate space for files on a simulated disk. The students should also include a mechanism for deleting, renaming and moving files. The simulation should run for a set amount of time and record the average amount of fragmentation and the number of wasted disk blocks at the end of each time unit. 

The students should also consider the following factors in their simulation:

• The employees will be creating and editing different types of files (e.g. documents, spreadsheets, images) with varying file sizes. 
• The employees will be frequently adding and deleting files. 
• The company wants to minimize the amount of wasted disk space. At the end of the simulation, the students should provide a report on their findings and observations, including the performance of the file system under different scenarios and the trade-offs involved in the different file allocation algorithms. 

Expected outcomes: 
1. File allocation: The program should demonstrate the ability to allocate space for files on a simulated disk using the chosen file allocation algorithm (e.g. Contiguous Allocation or Linked Allocation). 
2. File deletion and renaming: The program should include a mechanism for deleting and renaming files. 
3. Disk fragmentation: The program should record the average amount of fragmentation at the end of each time unit. Fragmentation occurs when there are small, unused blocks of disk space scattered throughout the disk space. 
4. Wasted disk space: The program should also record the number of wasted disk blocks at the end of each time unit. Wasted disk space refers to blocks of disk space that are no longer being used by any files. 
5. Simulation results: The program should run the simulation for a set amount of time and display the results, including the average amount of fragmentation and the number of wasted disk blocks, at the end of each time unit. The students should also experiment with different input scenarios and algorithms to compare the results and see how different factors affect the performance of the file system.
